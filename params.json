  "body": "### machelper for OS X\r\nmachelper is a command line tool for OS X to help mac/OSx86 users to do some specific tasks. Originally the idea was to ease my pain as I don't like so many apps installed on my PC for performing specific and very simple tasks. But after the creation of the tool, I realised that it could help others if I shared it with others.\r\n\r\n### Features\r\nThere are lots of features of this simple command line tool, and still adding:\r\n- Creation of bootable USB (USB installer) for both native mac and OSx86 users.\r\n * with Clover (for native Mac, use -excludeClover option)\r\n * only supports EFI/UEFI\r\n * ability to configure ethernet manually (with -ethernet option)\r\n * uses config.plist for laptops directly from RehabMan's repo (with -config option)\r\n * applies MBR patch (with -mbrPatch option)\r\n * replace kernel (with -replaceKernel option)\r\n- Kernel Extension (kext) administration\r\n * backup & install/uninstall a kext\r\n * fix permission(s)\r\n * rebuild cache\r\n- Extract DSDT/SSDTs as well as disassemble them\r\n- Mount EFI partition (needs further improvement)\r\n- Other tools:\r\n * copy Clover from USB installer to HDD/SSD (GPT only)\r\n * backup & uninstall (delete) kext from Single User Mode\r\n * list unsigned kext\r\n * allow the very installation of machelper on USB installer for further use\r\n * replace kernel from Single User Mode\r\n * disable Hibernation\r\n * export kernel log (not yet released)\r\n * backup & delete/restore all the graphics kext from /S/L/E (not yet released)\r\n& many more...\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nI am working on it (I haven't got enough time these days).\r\nBut simply running `machelper` from command line can provide you with help.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nI (@MuntashirAkon) am the author and currently the only contributor of this project.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nSee [issues](https://github.com/MuntashirAkon/machelper/issues).\r\n",
